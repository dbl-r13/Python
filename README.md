# Python

The Python files that are in this repo are ones that I have done through the various courses that I have taken to learn more about the language.

### FizzBuzz - User:

This file asks the user how many numbers that the user is wanting the script to go up to. Once it gets that number, it will then go through and make sure that it progresses through all the numbers to give the proper response of "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

### Lambda:

This file helps with practicing how to use a lambda in Python and also has a test using the 'assert' keyword to make sure it is working properly.

### Process Name:

This file takes input form the user and runs through a couple different conditions to spit out text that lets them know if their name is shorter, as long or longer than the average first name in the US, and if their name has any of the five most common letters in it.

### Colleciton Funcs:

This file is meant to show how we can run through different functions (Map, Filter, Reduce, and Sort) to show the different use cases for them and a proficient way to use them.
