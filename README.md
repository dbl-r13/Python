# Python
The Python files that are in this repo are ones that I have done through the various courses that I have taken to learn more about the language.

## FizzBuzz - User:
This file asks the user how many numbers that the user is wanting the script to go up to. Once it gets that number, it will then go through and make sure that it progresses through all the numbers to give the proper response of "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".
